 * Callout(ðŸ¤– TJBot Hardware):
 In order to complete this exercise, please ensure your TJBot has a speaker.
 
 Your TJBot now has the ability to speak! Using the [Watson Text to Speech](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/text-to-speech/) service, your TJBot is able to express himself with his own voice.
 
 **Goal**: Have your TJBot tell you the details of his life's story aloud. Use the `generateLifeStory()` method to generate TJBot's life story, and the `tj.speak()` method to make your TJBot speak!

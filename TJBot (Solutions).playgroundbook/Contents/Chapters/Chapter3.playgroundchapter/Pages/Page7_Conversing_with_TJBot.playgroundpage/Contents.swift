 * Callout(ü§ñ TJBot Hardware):
 In order to complete this exercise, please ensure your TJBot has a microphone and a speaker.
 
 Did you know you can turn TJBot into a chatbot? TJBot has the ability to engage in a back-and-forth conversation using the [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/) service.
 
 * Callout(‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisite):
 In order to complete this exercise, you will need to define a conversation flow in the [Watson Assistant tool](https://www.ibmwatsonconversation.com/login). Step-by-step instructions for how to do this can be found in this [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Talking-Robot-With-Watson-and-Raspberry-Pi/) (step 6). Log into the [Watson Assistant tool](https://www.ibmwatsonconversation.com/login) tool to create a conversation flow, and take note of the Workspace ID. Note that you need a [Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) account to be able to use the Watson Assistant tool.
 
 **Goal**: Engage in a conversation with TJBot using the `tj.converse(workspaceId:message:)`, `tj.listen(_:)`, and `tj.speak(_:)` methods.
 
 * Callout(üí° Tip):
 If you are near your computer, you can import a sample TJBot conversation flow into the Watson Assistant tool. Check out the [Conversation recipe](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot/tree/master/recipes/conversation) in TJBot's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ibmtjbot/tjbot). It has a sample conversation file you can use to get started.
 
 The `tj.converse(workspaceId:message:)` method returns a `ConversationResponse` object. This object contains the `text` response that TJBot should speak.
 
 * Callout(‚ö†Ô∏è Caution):
 Check the `error` property on the `ConversationResponse` just in case Watson returns an error!
